(a) SINGLE NODE – SINGLENODE.CPP

AIM:

To create a single node in a linked list and display its value.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains data and a pointer to the next node. A single node contains only one data element and a next pointer set to null.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Define a Node class with data and next pointer.

Initialize head pointer as null.

Input value for a single node.

Create a new node and assign it to head.

Display the data of the node by traversing from head.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully creates and displays a single node in a linked list.

(b) ADD MULTIPLE NODES AT END – ADDEND.CPP

AIM:

To add multiple nodes at the end of a linked list and display the list.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

In a singly linked list, nodes can be added at the end by traversing to the last node and updating its next pointer to the new node.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Define a Node class with data and next pointer.

Initialize head pointer as null.

Input the number of nodes and values for each node.

For each value, create a new node.

If the list is empty, assign head to new node.

Else, traverse to the last node and link it to the new node.

Display the linked list by traversing from head.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully adds multiple nodes at the end of a linked list and displays the list.

(c) ADD MULTIPLE NODES AT START – ADDSTART.CPP

AIM:

To add multiple nodes at the start of a linked list and display the list.

APPARATUS:

Laptop with C++ compiler (MinGW), Text Editor / IDE (VS Code), Terminal/Console (Command Prompt).

THEORY:

Nodes can be inserted at the beginning of a singly linked list by creating a new node and updating its next pointer to the current head, then updating head to the new node.

ALGORITHM:

Start the program and include necessary header files.

Define a Node class with data and next pointer.

Initialize head pointer as null.

Input the number of nodes and values for each node.

For each value, create a new node.

Set new node’s next pointer to head and update head to new node.

Display the linked list by traversing from head.

Stop the program.

CONCLUSION:

The program successfully adds multiple nodes at the start of a linked list and displays the list
